                    <p class="text-muted">Following the events of September 11th, Dr. Ponichtera wondered how America could respond to these tragic events in a manner befitting its political identity.  Having just read a number of monographs on the founding of the United States, he was reminded of how seriously people like John Adams and Thomas Jefferson valued concepts like democracy, liberty, and freedom.  How could their belief in these ideals be kept alive and relevant for today’s Americans?  What made the United States the country of choice for people around the world who sought a better life for themselves and their families?  Finally, he wondered about the impact of our changing demographics.  How could America’s republican experiment, which has set us apart from monarchies, dictatorships, and other types of authoritarian regimes, remain vital and strong given a vast influx of new immigrants from countries that, by and large, had no experience with democratic government?</p>

                    <p class="text-muted">A colleague suggested working with youth.  Soon thereafter, it all came together.  The answer was Liberty’s Promise.  Here was an organization that would endeavor to remind us of our collective immigrant past and recall our tradition of embracing new arrivals by engaging our society's newest members in their communities and introducing them to the opportunities available to them. Liberty’s Promise was incorporated in 2003, and officially opened its doors on August 11, 2005.  To date, we’ve served over 3,500 immigrant youth from <a href="/pages/map" class="site-link">117 different countries</a> through <a href="/pages/what_we_do.html" class="site-link">after-school civic engagement programs and professional internships</a>. We strive to make a a <a href="/pages/our_impact" class="site-link">lasting impact</a> on our youth by helping them get involved in their communities, showing them the pathways to higher educational and meaningful careers, and providing the personal support and long-term mentoring they need to realize their individual American dreams.</p>
