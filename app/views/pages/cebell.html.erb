                <p class="text-muted"><i><strong> Civic Engagement for Beginning English Language Learners (CE-BELL)</strong></i> is a modified version of our Civics and Citizenship after-school program, which is explicitly designed for this steadily growing population of low-level (I-II) ESOL students. The vision for CE-BELL is to create an environment that inspires our immigrant youth  to dream bigger and explore the endless opportunities this country offers them. This program is run entirely in Spanish. Through this approach, students leave each session with a greater sense of confidence in themselves knowing that their strengths and cultural diversity are valued. Successful immigrant guest speakers are invited and they will share their stories with our youth to instill motivation and encouragement into their lives. CE-BELL includes a modest English language component and all the activities are designed to be of the most use and relevance to the communityâ€™s newest arrivals. CE-BELL provides the perfect opportunity for students to develop self-worth, as well as help them set personal goals, improve attendance, and ensure diploma completion.</p>
