                    <p class="text-muted">The statistics for the educational achievements of our youth far outweigh those of their demographic: according to the John Hopkins University and Pew Research Center, low-income students have a high school graduation rate of only <strong><u>74%</u></strong> and a college enrollment rate of just <strong><u>51%.</u></strong> We've worked with youth who didn't believe they would finish high school who have now earned degrees from schools like the University of Maryland. Youth who thought they would spend their lives working dead-end service jobs rae now employed by companies like Bank of America, Guggenheim Investments, and Nestle International. We are honored to have helped so many young people realize their dreams.</p>
